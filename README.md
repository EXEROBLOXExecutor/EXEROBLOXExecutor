# Official .EXE ROBLOX Executor GitHub

## What is .EXE?
.EXE is a free, keyless ROBLOX executor which runs on multiple Exploit API's!
(For those who don't know, the name is supposed to be short for .EXECUTOR)
Currently, it supports the WeAreDevs API and the EasyExploits API!
There are possibilities that .EXE will receive more API Support updates, but these are the two right now.

## Who made .EXE?
.EXE is programmed by me, ZDev! I'm a relatively new programmer who mainly does C#.
I have intentions to branch out to explore more Python for backend and maybe Rust for game development.

## How can I contribute to .EXE?
.EXE, once released, will have a public GitHub repository, meaning contributions will be possible via GitHub!
However, that is for when it releases. For right now, you can join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DMc7f54WSY)
and give suggestions as well as request to become a Tester! I plan to add a support ticket channel, so when that is created,
if you want to, you can open one and request to become a tester. (There will be a couple of questions asked before you receive tester.)
